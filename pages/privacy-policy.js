          <br />
          <br />
          a. &apos;session cookies&apos; , which are stored only temporarily
          during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system
          and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed;
          <br />
          <br />
          b. &apos;persistent cookies&apos;, which are read only by the Site,
          saved on your computer for a fixed period and are not deleted when the
          browser is closed. Such cookies are used where we need to know who you

          We use a tool which is based on the Snowplow Analytics technology to
          collect information about your use of the Site. The tool collects
          information such as how often users access the Site, which pages they
          visit when they do so, etc. The tool does not collect any Personal
          Information and is only used by our Site hosting and operating service

          &#40;Google Web Fonts&#41;.
          <br />
          In order to present our contents correctly and make them graphically
          appealing across all browsers, we use script libraries and font
          libraries such as Google Web Fonts
          &#40;https://www.google.com/webfonts&#41; on this website. Google Web
          Fonts are transferred to your browser&apos;s cache to avoid multiple
          loading. If your browser does not support Google Web Fonts or does not
          allow access, content will be displayed in a default font. Calling
          script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection
          to the library operator. In theory, it is possible &#45; but currently
          also unclear whether and, if so, for what purposes &#45; that
          operators of corresponding libraries collect data. The privacy policy
          of the library operator Google can be found here:
          https://www.google.com/policies/privacy. Third-party collection of

          information you disclose to them. Accordingly, we encourage you to
          read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party
          that you choose to disclose information to.
          <br />
          <br />
